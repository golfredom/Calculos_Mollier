This lybrary has some dependencies that should be add in he Arduino Sketch, please download and add this libraries to your Arduino folder:

Dallas Control Lybrary: https://github.com/milesburton/Arduino-Temperature-Control-Library
OneWire (in case that you use OneWire compatible items): http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/arduino_libraries/OneWire.zip
