Calculos_Mollier
================

Library for Mollier calculation applied for arduino, it uses a dry bulb and wet bulb for absolute humidity sensing.

The library example has some dependencies that should be add in the Arduino IDE and Sketch in case that you use the temperature sensor DS18B20, this is the one we where using at the moment of development, please download and add this libraries to your Arduino libraries folder:

Dallas Control Library: https://github.com/milesburton/Arduino-Temperature-Control-Library

OneWire (in case that you use OneWire compatible items): http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/arduino_libraries/OneWire.zip


This library should work with any other temperature sensor.

Happy coding.
